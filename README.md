# Overview

This project consists of a command-line-based 'Task Manager' app implemented using Kotlin as a programming language. The main goal of this project is to ensure an adequate grasp of Kotlin basics such as its syntax, object-oriented concepts, and utilization of collections. Users can interactively add, view, and delete tasks with the aid of this task manager app.

The project was designed to help me grow as a software engineer by furthering my experience in Kotlin, as well as evaluating how the language compares to Java. The project showcases various features in Kotlin, ranging from data classes to mutable and immutable variables, control structures, loops, functions, and managing lists.
